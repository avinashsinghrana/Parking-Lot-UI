// Copilot Project Instructions
//
// 1. Use consistent routing: Each page/component should have its own route in App.js using React Router's <Route>.
// 2. For loading indicators, use the animated logo-loading.svg as a spinner. Keep the animation clockwise and visually consistent.
// 3. For error messages, use the .error-msg CSS class: red color, margin-top: 0, margin-bottom: 10px, font-size: 0.95em.
// 4. For forms (login, forget password, etc.), use input-group and consistent button styles as in Login.css.
// 5. For new pages, create a dedicated component in the appropriate folder (e.g., src/components/PageName/PageName.js).
// 6. Import and use images/assets from the src/ directory, not public/.
// 7. Use semantic HTML and accessible labels for all forms and buttons.
// 8. Remove unused imports and code to keep files clean.
// 9. Always validate and test new features for edge cases and UI consistency.
// 10. Keep all new SVG or image assets in the src/ directory for easy import in React components.
//
// Update this file with any new project-wide conventions or requirements as they arise.
